# Homework 2 - A*, RRT and RRT* for Motion Planning

This assignment focuses on implementing a simulation environment for a 2-DOF planar robot arm using PyBullet. Students will also implement a control algorithm to solve the given problem. The main document for this assignment can be found [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse571/23sp/homeworks/CSE571_HW2.pdf).

For additional reference, consult the following lecture slides:
- [Lecture 10: Deterministic Planning - Search Methods](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse571/23sp/slides/L10/Lecture10_DeterministicPlanning.pdf)
- [Lecture 11: Sampling Based Motion Planning](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse571/23sp/slides/L11/Lecture11_SamplingBasedPlanning.pdf)


## Prerequisites

Install the required Python packages:

`pip install pybullet numpy`

## Implementing the Control Algorithm

The key goal of this homework is to get an understanding of motion planning methods including A∗, RRT, and RRT∗.

To complete the assignment, students should implement the following:

1. A*, RRT, RRT* for the Arm Environment.
2. RRT for the Car Environment.
3. Test the algorithms and analyze the results.

## Submission

We will be using the Canvas for submission of the assignments. Please submit the written assignment answers
as a PDF. For the code, submit a zip file of the entire working directory.
